# Fix the last line so that it outputs the sum
# of 1 and 2
a = "1"
b = 2
# print(a+b)
print(int(a) + b)

# Values in Python can be of different types. In this exercise,
# the value assigned to a  was of string type (i.e., text) while
#  the value of b  was an integer (i.e., whole number), and you
# cannot add strings with integers. Therefore we needed to convert
# the string to an integer using the int()  addition operation's
#  built-in function to be possible.
