# What is wrong with the following script?
a = 1

_a2 = 3
# 2a = 4

# Line 5 throws a SyntaxError because variable
# names cannot start with a number
# Variable names must start with a letter or an
# underscore. Everything else will throw a
# syntax error.

# The underscore prefix is meant as a hint to another
# programmer that a variable or method is intended for
# internal use.
